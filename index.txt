timing events:
Timing Events :
    --it allows execution of code at specified time intervals.
    --These time intervals are called timing events.
The two key methods to use with JavaScript are:
1.setTimeout(function, milliseconds)--it delays the code execution for a particular of time. 
2.setInterval(function, milliseconds)--it executes repeatedly as a loop with a time interval.

To Stop The Execution--to stop the execution we can assign timing function rto a variable.
1.clearTimeout()-- method stops the execution of the function specified in setTimeout().
2.clearInterval()-- method stops the executions of the function specified in the setInterval() method.
